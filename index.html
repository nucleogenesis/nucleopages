                      <p>					  <b>Don’t use notifications that dismiss on a timer for critical or emergency messages.</b> Some users with disabilities need more time to read or interact with messages and timed actionable toasts may not provide sufficient time. <a href="https:www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/no-timing.html">WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.2.4 (AAA)</a>
                        <br />
</p>

                      <p>					  <b>Users should be able to manage or limit noncritical notifications.</b> This gives users the control to reduce the number of distractions or disruptions they receive, which is particularly helpful for users with cognitive limitations. <a href="https:www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/interruptions.html">WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.2.3 (AAA)</a>

                      <p>Label all dialog controls, including the close button. Each dialog should have a clearly labelled control for closing it. Icon-based buttons for closing [x] must have an accessible name that is read out to screen reader users.</p>

                      <p>Use <code>polite</code> to make screen-readers <i>aware</i> without stealing focus (aria-live =&gt; polite vs assertive) - polite lets the user know there is a notification, but doesn&apos;t steal focus, assertive will force the user to focus the notification</p>
